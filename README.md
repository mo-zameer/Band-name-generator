# Band-name-generator
This project is a web application built using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and Node.js that generates unique band names. Users can click a button to generate a random name composed of an adjective and a noun.

Key Features:

Random Name Generation: The application leverages JavaScript's random number generation capabilities to select random adjectives and nouns from predefined lists.
EJS Templating: EJS is used to dynamically render the generated band name on the webpage, providing a user-friendly interface.
Node.js Backend: A Node.js server handles the logic for generating random names and serving the EJS template.
User Interaction: A simple button click triggers the name generation process, providing an intuitive user experience.

To run the project:
Ensure you have Node.js and its package manager npm installed on your system.
Open your terminal or command prompt and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the directory where your Node.js project is located and run the following commands:
npm init
npm i
node index.js
